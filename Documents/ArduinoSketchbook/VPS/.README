## VPS - Velostat Pressure Sensors ##

A cheap DIY project for creating an interactive dancefloor w/ Arduino microcontrollers, 
looong LED strips, and -- most importantly -- a big 'ol square of astro-turf laid atop 
a network of homebrewed Velostat pressure sensors.

Each Uno manages:
* processing separate analog inputs from a column of 4 piezoresistive Velostat sensors
* coordinating 2 analog RGB LED strips to dynamically react to corresponding VPS readings
* time based events

Goal is for a 16 matrix (4x4) of these hacked-together Velostat pads, requiring the code
to run on 4 individual boards.
